    <p>My background in sales, customer service, team and community building leads me to approach situations from a
        space of vulnerablity,compassion,vigor and empathy.
        Time is of the essensce and a pivitoal point of strategy and success.
    </p>
    <p>Years of training in the beauty industry,the real estate industry, met with challanges
        both on and off the mat, divine timing has allowed our paths to connect.
        Style, structure,comfort at times discomfort have been the fabric that has glued many
        lifelong connections and partnerships.
        Allow me to use my keen skillset to accomodate different dynamics and perspectives for
        your ecosystem of success and opportunity to flourish.
        I know the client side, I know the server side, I know the stakes involved, now its time
        you know you have me on your side.
    </p>
